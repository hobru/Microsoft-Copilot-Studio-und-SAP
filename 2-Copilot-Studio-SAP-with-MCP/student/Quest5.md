[< 🔌 Quest 4](Quest4.md)  - **[Quest 6 >](Quest6.md)**

## 7.1 Test the new Agent
Now we are ready to test the new agent and access data from the SAP system


In the **Test your agent** screen, enter a question, e.g. ```Show me 5 sales orders```

 ![Enter ask the first question](../images/quest7/step01.png) 

Since we are now testing the agent as an end-user we need to authenticate to the MCP server. Click on **Open connection manager** to open the connection options

 ![Open Connection](../images/quest7/step02.png) 
 

In our case we don’t need to provide any additional authentication details. Just click on **Connect**

 ![Manage your connections](../images/quest7/step03.png) 

 

The connection should now show a successful connection. Click on **Submit** 

 ![Submit Connections](../images/quest7/step04.png) 
 
With the status of the connection now showing *Connected*, switch back to the browser window with Copilot Studio

 ![Show connected](../images/quest7/step05.png) 
 

Where you can click on **Retry** or enter your question again:
